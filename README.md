# sustain.md (WIP)
The file every project should [eventually] have in their repo.

## Why

After reading [Giving Open-Source Projects Life After a Developer's Death](https://www.wired.com/story/giving-open-source-projects-life-after-a-developers-death/) I think it is time as sustainers, we take on the responsibility of creating a spec/standard/recommendation for all open source projects to use in case of untimely deaths.

## Manifesto

We felt in order to move forward we must have a set of principles. We have created [manifesto.md](manifesto.md). We encourage you to join the [conversation](https://discourse.sustainoss.org/t/sustainers-manifesto/39).
